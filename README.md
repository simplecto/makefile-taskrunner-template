# Purpose
I use a Makefile as a task-runner. You can put this in your folder and modify as you see fit.

## Requirements
I make some assumptions here.

  1. You know what Makefiles are and you kinda-sorta know how to use them
  2. You have `make` installed on your computer. For macos you can use `xcode-select` from the command line.

## Usage
Simply copy the Makefile into a folder where you will run your shortcuts or automations. 
Simple typing `make` in the same folder shoudl output the following:

```
simplecto:~ sam$ curl -sL https://simplecto.com/makefile/ > Makefile
simplecto:~ sam$ make
sample                         This is a sample command
simplecto:~ sam$
```



If you see the above then you are good to go. Simply start making additions to your `Makefile`.
